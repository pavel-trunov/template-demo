## Build, Run and Release

### Setup project specific development environment

```shell
make setup
```

Don't forget to configure your `.env` file with the required environment variables.

Notes:
1. .env.example is provided as a template, use ```cp .env.example .env``` and edit ```.env``` to create your environment.
2. .env is excluded from version control, so feel free to add secret values.

### Build

```shell
make        # Runs primary build steps, i.e. formatting, linting, testing, building HTML docs and distribution, auditing
make help   # Shows help with additional build targets, e.g. to build PDF documentation, bump the version to release etc.
```

Notes:
1. Primary build steps defined in `noxfile.py`.
2. Distribution dumped into ```dist/```
3. Documentation dumped into ```docs/build/html/``` and ```docs/build/latex/```
4. Audit reports dumped into ```reports/```

### Run the CLI

```shell
uv run template-demo # shows help
```

### Commit and Push your changes

```shell
git add .
git commit -m "feat(user): added new api endpoint to offboard user"
git push
```

Notes:
1. [pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com/) will run automatically on commit to ensure code quality.
2. We use the conventional commits format - see the [code style guide](CODE_STYLE.md) for the mandatory commit message format.

### Publish Release

```shell
make bump   # Patch release
make minor  # Patch release
make major  # Patch release
make x.y.z  # Targeted release
```

Notes:
1. Changelog generated automatically
2. Publishes to PyPi, Docker Registries, Read The Docs, Streamlit and Auditing services


## Advanced usage

### Developing the GUI

To run the GUI in the browser with hot reloading, use the following command:

```shell
make gui_watch
```

### Running GitHub CI Workflow locally

```shell
make act
```

Notes:
1. Workflow defined in `.github/workflows/*.yml`
2. ci-cd.yml calls all build steps defined in noxfile.py

### Docker

Build and run the Docker image with plain Docker

```shell
# Build from Dockerimage
make docker_build # builds targets all and slim

# Run the CLI
docker run --env THE_VAR=THE_VALUE -t template-demo --target all --help    # target with all extras
docker run --env THE_VAR=THE_VALUE -t template-demo --target slim --help   # slim flavor, no extras
```

Build and run the Docker image with docker compose:

```shell
echo "Building the Docker image with docker compose and running CLI..."
docker compose run --build template-demo --help
echo "Building the Docker image with docker compose and running API container as a daemon ..."
docker compose up --build -d
echo "Waiting for the API server to start..."
sleep 5
echo "Checking health of v1 API ..."
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/healthz
echo ""
echo "Saying hello world with v1 API ..."
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/hello/world
echo ""
echo "Swagger docs of v1 API ..."
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/docs
echo ""
echo "Checking health of v2 API ..."
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v2/healthz
echo ""
echo "Saying hello world with v1 API ..."
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v2/hello/world
echo ""
echo "Swagger docs of v2 API ..."
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v2/docs
echo ""
echo "Shutting down the API container ..."
docker compose down
```

Notes:
1. The API service is run based on the slim Docker image. Change in compose.yaml if you need the API service to run on the fat image.


### Pinning GitHub Actions

```shell
pinact run  # See https://dev.to/suzukishunsuke/pin-github-actions-to-a-full-length-commit-sha-for-security-2n7p
```


## Update from Template

Update project to latest version of [oe-python-template](https://github.com/helmut-hoffer-von-ankershoffen/oe-python-template) template.

```shell
make update_from_template
```


## Pull Request Guidelines

1. Before starting to write code read the [code style](CODE_STYLE.md) document for mandatory coding style requirements.
2. **Pre-Commit Hooks:** We use pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality. Please install the pre-commit hooks by running `uv run pre-commit install`. This ensure all tests, linting etc. pass locally before you can commit.
3. **Squash Commits:** Before submitting a pull request, please squash your commits into a single commit.
4. **Signed Commits:** Use [signed commits](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits).
5. **Branch Naming:** Use descriptive branch names like `feature/your-feature` or `fix/issue-number`.
6. **Testing:** Ensure new features have appropriate test coverage.
7. **Documentation:** Update documentation to reflect any changes or new features.
